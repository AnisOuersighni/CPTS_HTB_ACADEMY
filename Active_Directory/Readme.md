### Getting Started with Active Directory: What I Wish I Knew a Year Ago

When I first started exploring Active Directory (AD), I made the classic mistake of diving straight into the attack phase without fully understanding the foundational concepts. It was overwhelming, to say the least. A lack of clarity on key terms and their relationships can slow down your learning curve—and it certainly did for me.

So, I wanted to share something that I believe will help Starter build a strong foundation before jumping into enumeration and attacks.

# Where to Start?
I highly recommend HackTheBox’s **“Introduction to Active Directory”** module as a beginner-friendly resource. Once you’re comfortable with the basics, you can move on to the Active Directory Enumeration & Attacks module. The content is practical, engaging, and will set you up for success.

Additionally, I found Microsoft’s official documentation to be invaluable for understanding the technical definitions of terms. Pairing these resources helped me build a more comprehensive view of the AD environment.

# The Cheatsheet
I’ve put together a brief cheatsheet covering the fundamental terms you’ll encounter in an AD environment. It’s concise but detailed where it matters. For some terms, I’ve included insights I gathered from deep dives into various blogs, as they helped me gain clarity on complex concepts.

**Pro Tip**: If you're short on time, focus on the red-highlighted keywords in each section of the cheatsheet. These are the key points to commit to memory.

I hope this resource helps simplify your journey into Active Directory. Remember, it’s not about rushing into attacks but building a solid foundation first. Feel free to reach out with questions or feedback—I’d love to hear from you!
